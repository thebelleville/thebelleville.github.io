              <p>The Interior Architectural Design strikes a unique balance between the familiar and the
stimulating as it introduces the outdoors as an additional story of the space. Floor to ceiling
windows connect indoors and outdoors seamlessly. Natural materials such as white oak create
a warm and tranquil atmosphere. Soft architectural lighting enhances the natural light to
create a comfortable ambiance.</p>
